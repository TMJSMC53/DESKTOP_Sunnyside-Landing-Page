## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was able to focus on the basics of layout using Flexbox and Grid. Also, how important it is when using percentages for widths instead of fixed.

### Continued development

I am going to continue practicing Flexbox and Grid, so that I can create more responsive layouts. Also, I am going to dive into Sass, which I did not use in this project, because I noticed that I thrive on organization, especially in coding.
